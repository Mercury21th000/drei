## Commit Guidelines

Be sure your commit messages follow this specification: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/

## Storybook

If you're adding a brand new feature, you need to make sure you add a storybook entry. Storybook has `@storybook/addon-knobs` installed, so make use of them to show off. The most important thing about a story is to be simple & show the essence of the component, remember some people may be looking at using `drei` for the first time & it's important the stories are clear and concise.

If you want to make a more advanced example why not create a codesandbox & be sure to make use of [`use-tweaks`](https://github.com/pmndrs/use-tweaks)!
